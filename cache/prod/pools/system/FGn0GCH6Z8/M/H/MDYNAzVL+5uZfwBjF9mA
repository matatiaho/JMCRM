You can save an unlimited number of custom searches and layouts. All saved searches appear by name in the Saved Searches list, with the last loaded saved search appearing at the top of the list.<br><br>To customize the List View layout, use the Hide Columns and Display Columns boxes to select which fields to display in the search results. For example, you can view or hide details such as the record name, and assigned user, and assigned team in the search results. To add a column to List View, select the field from the Hide Columns list and use the left arrow to move it to the Display Columns list. To remove a column from List View, select it from the Display Columns list and use the right arrow to move it to the Hide Columns list.<br><br>If you save layout settings, you will be able to load them at any time to view the search results in the custom layout.<br><br>To save and update a search and/or layout:<ol><li>Enter a name for the search results in the <b>Save this search as</b> field and click <b>Save</b>.The name now displays in the Saved Searches list adjacent to the <b>Clear</b> button.</li><li>To view a saved search, select it from the Saved Searches list.

For example instead of just searching for results that equal "Apples" you could change your search to "Apples%" which would match all results that start with the word Apples but could contain other characters as well.</p>',
